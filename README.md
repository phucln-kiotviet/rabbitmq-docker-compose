# RabbitMQ with docker-compose

- My first rabbitMQ with docker-compose to test access control on RabbitMQ :D
- Ticket from: https://citigo.atlassian.net/browse/KO-7579


- Use docker-compose command to start rabbitMQ:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

- Access: `localhost:15672` to access RabbitMQ and user `guest/guest` for user/password :D.
